/**
 * Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
 *
 * <p>An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
 *
 * <p>For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: x = 121 Output: true Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to
 * left. Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: x = -121 Output: false Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to
 * left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome. Example 3:
 *
 * <p>Input: x = 10 Output: false Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a
 * palindrome.
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 *
 * <p>-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 *
 * <p>Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
